The game is played on a square board with a 5Ã—5 grid. Each player has six cubes, numbered one to six. During setup, each player can arrange the cubes as he or she sees fit within the triangular area of their own color. The players take turns rolling a six-sided die and then moving the matching cube. If the matching cube is no longer on the board, the player moves a remaining cube whose number is next-highest or next-lowest to the rolled number. The player starting in the top-left may move that cube one square to the right, down, or on the diagonal down and to the right; the player starting in the bottom-right may move that cube one square to the top, left, or on the diagonal up and to the left. Any cube which already lies in the target square is removed from the board. The object of the game is to either for a player to get one of their cubes to the far corner square in the grid (where their opponent started) or to remove all of their opponent's cubes from the board.
